# Network_capacity-routing_algo
•	Implemented a network capacity and routing algorithm, utilizing the Capacity Scaling Algorithm to find the maximum packet size transferable between routers in a computer network 
•	Achieved O (n log n) time complexity through optimized data structures and efficient traversal, traced the routing path from source to target, considering links with matching capacities
